A basic interpreter written in C without Compiler Design Concepts, solely based on Data Structures.

Interpreting Procedure:

1. Start BYKIG.exe.

2. Enter the desired file name.

3. Enter.

Coding Guide:

1. '.' to mark end of the program.

2. 'out' for output. Every string, variable, separator and semicolon must have space.

3. 'in' can only take input and the logic of out applies to n as well.

4. During variable assignment, the variable to be assigned and the rest of the expression including '=' must have a single spce of separation.

5. use'%' to print newline('%n'), double quotes('%"') and plus('+').

6. '~' is used instead of '=='.

7. '!' is used in stead of '!='.
